# CRUD API Design in Node.js

this is a simple CRUD project, where I design and build APIs from scratch using Node.js! Throughout this project, I leverage the power of Express to handle routes and create a robust REST API. By integrating Prisma and TypeScript, I ensure seamless interactions with a Postgres database. Additionally, I implement authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to secure and restrict access to the API. Finally, I explore the process of deploying the API,i will be dockerizing it later
